# Re-Defend üï∞Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏è
Re-Defend is a strategic tower defense game with a unique time manipulation mechanic. Developed over the course of 3 weeks, this game was my submission for the IIT Tech Fest Game Begetter. While it successfully passed the initial evaluation and was selected for an APK check, I ran out of time to fully refine it.
This project combines the intensity of tower defense with a fresh, mind-bending approach to strategy, rewarding creativity and efficient problem-solving.
